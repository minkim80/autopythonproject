# autopythonproject

**My problem:** I had a folder full of screenshots from my online course notes and having to crop the _images_ manually was very time consuming and tedious. 

**My solution:** I decided to create a simple script utilizing Image & glob module to automate the process. 

A small python project to automate tedious tasks such as cropping hundreds of images.
